About
The Northern California Computational Biology (NCCB) Student Symposium is a oneÂ­-day student symposium organized by the NCCB Planning Committee made up of students from UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UCSF, and Stanford. The symposium offers an excellent opportunity to connect with the local computational biology student community and to learn about current research projects involving the many facets of computational biology. Our program will also include presentations from a UC Berkeley faculty member and an industry bioinformatics researcher.
